# Documentation

This project contains a basic documentation system.
It uses Doxygen to generate docs from comments in the code.
Use the `BUILD_DOCS` CMake option to turn this on/off.

Note that you don't need to make any changes here; I just wanted this to serve as a reasonable, general-purpose project template.
